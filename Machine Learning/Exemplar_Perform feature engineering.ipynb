I will help NBA managers and coaches identify which players are most likely to thrive in the high-pressure environment of professional basketball and help the team be successful over time.\n\nTo do this, I will analyze a subset of data that contains information about NBA players and their performance records. I will conduct feature engineering to determine which features will most effectively predict whether a player's NBA career will last at least five years. The insights gained then will be used in the next stage of the project: building the predictive model.\n",

Keep in mind the goal is to identify features that will serve as useful predictors for the target variable, `target_5yrs`.  \n\n- You should avoid selecting the `name` column as a feature. A player's name is not helpful in determining their career duration. Moreover, it may not be ethical or fair to predict a player's career duration based on a name.\n- The number of games a player has played in may not be as important in determining their career duration as the number of points they have earned. While you could say that someone who has played in more games may have more practice and experience, the points they earn during the games they played in would speak more to their performance as a player. This, in turn, would influence their career duration. So, the `gp` column on its own may not be a helpful feature. However, `gp` and `pts` could be combined to get the total number of points earned across the games played, and that result could be a helpful feature. That approach can be implemented later in the feature engineering process—in feature extraction. \n- If the number of points earned across games will be extracted as a feature, then that could be combined with the number of minutes played across games (`min * gp`) to extract another feature. This could be a measure of players' efficiency and could help in predicting players' career duration. `min` on its own may not be useful as a feature for the same reason as `gp`.\n- There are three different columns that give information about field goals. The percent of field goals a player makes (`fg`) says more about their performance than the number of field goals they make (`fgm`) or the number of field goals they attempt (`fga`). The percent gives more context, as it takes into account both how many field goals a player successfully made and how many field goals they attempted in total. This allows for a more meaningful comparison between players. The same logic applies to the percent of three-point field goals made, as well as the percent of free throws made. \n- There are columns for the number offensive rebounds (`oreb`), the number of defensive rebounds (`dreb`), and the number of rebounds overall (`reb`). Because the overall number of rebounds should already incorporate both offensive and defensive rebounds, it would make sense to use the overall as a feature. \n- The number of assists (`ast`), steals (`stl`), blocks (`blk`), and turnovers (`tov`) also provide information about how well players are performing in games, and thus, could be helpful in predicting how long players last in the league. \n\nTherefore, at this stage of the feature engineering process, it would be most effective to select the following columns: \n\n`gp`, `min`, `pts`, `fg`, `3p`, `ft`, `reb`, `ast`, `stl`, `blk`, `tov`.",

Are there any transformations necessary for the features you want to use?\n- Many types of models are designed in a way that requires the data coming in to be numerical. So, transforming categorical features into numerical features is an important step. \n- In this particular dataset, `name` is the only categorical column and the other columns are numerical (discussed in response to Question 2). Given that `name` is not selected as a feature, all of the features that are selected at this point are already numerical and do not require transformation. ",

It might be helpful to combine these columns to get the total number of points the player has earned across the games and use the result as a new feature, which could be added into a new column named `total_points`. The total points earned by a player can reflect their performance and shape their career longevity. \n  - The `min` column represents the average number of minutes played per game. `total_points` could be combined with `min` and `gp` to extract a new feature: points earned per minute. This can be considered a measure of player efficiency, which could shape career duration. This feature can be added into a column named `efficiency`.",

If the target column in a dataset has more than 90% of its values belonging to one class, it is recommended to redistribute the data; otherwise, once a model is trained on the imbalanced data and predictions are made, the predictions may be biased. \n- Feature selection involves choosing features that help predict the target variable and removing columns that may not be helpful for prediction. In this process, and throughout feature engineering, it is important to make ethical considerations.  \n- Feature transformation involves transforming features so that they are more usable for future modeling purposes, which includes encoding categorical features to turn them into numerical features. \n- Feature extraction involves combining existing columns meaningfully to construct new features that would help improve prediction. \n\n**What summary would you provide to stakeholders? Consider key attributes to be shared from the data, as well as upcoming project plans.**\n- The following attributes about player performance could help predict their NBA career duration and should be included in a presentation to stakeholders: field goals, three-point field goals, free throws, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, total points, and efficiency as points per minute. \n- It would be important to explain that these attributes, along with a relevant dataset, will be used in the next stage of the project. At that point, a model will be built to predict a player's career duration. Insights gained will be shared with stakeholders once the project is complete. Stakeholders would also appreciate being provided with a timeline and key deliverables that they can expect to receive.",
